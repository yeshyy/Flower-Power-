    <h2>🌷 The Power of Flowers:</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Flowers are more than just beautiful decorations — they are living symbols of nature’s intelligence and creativity. From the tiniest wild blooms to majestic tropical orchids, flowers are intricate systems designed for pollination, reproduction, and survival. Their colors, shapes, and fragrances have evolved over millions of years to attract specific pollinators, helping plants reproduce and ensuring ecosystems thrive. Every flower carries within it the miracle of life and connection between species.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Beyond biology, flowers hold deep cultural and emotional significance across the world. In different cultures, flowers are used to mark important life events: birth, marriage, love, grief, and remembrance. A single rose can say more than words, while a bouquet of lilies or tulips can offer comfort, hope, or celebration. Throughout history, flowers have inspired poetry, art, healing, and even resistance. They remind us of beauty in fleeting moments and the emotional language that lives beyond speech.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">To truly understand the power of flowers is to explore both science and soul. They teach us about resilience — blooming in harsh environments, enduring storms, and returning with the seasons. They also remind us to pause, appreciate the present, and find meaning in everyday things. The deeper we look, the more we discover: flowers are not just part of nature — they are storytellers, healers, messengers, and timeless companions of the human spirit.</p>
