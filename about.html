    <div class="about-box">
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        <strong>Flower Power!</strong> is a website made to showcase the natural, emotional, and symbolic power of flowers. It was created not just to show their beauty, but to help people understand how flowers affect our emotions, culture, and even our health. From their biological roles in nature to the deep meanings they carry when given as gifts, this site celebrates everything flowers stand for.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Youâ€™ll find information about their importance in ecosystems, their cultural meanings, how botany explains their function, and fun facts about rare or symbolic flowers. The goal is to make people appreciate flowers on a deeper level â€” not just as pretty plants, but as silent messengers of love, hope, peace, and joy.

    <h2>ðŸ’Œ A Short Note from the Creator</h2>

    <div class="letter-box">
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting this website! I created Flower Power as a school performance task, but it became something I really enjoyed working on. Flowers are more than decorations â€” they help us express feelings and tell stories in quiet, beautiful ways. I hope this site helps you see that too. âœ¨
